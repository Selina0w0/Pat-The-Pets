2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it?<br />
This was my first time using Javascript, HTML, and CSS, so I spent more time learning the formatting and getting used to them. I looked up many different resources, documentations, and videos explaning how different functions work and how these languages work together. There are a lot of times where I had to decide on one of the sources to focus on more or combine information from multiple sources together for my code. <br />
The part that I spend the most time on was implementing the timer because I didn't think of using libraries that could simplify it by a lot and I had to make sure that I started and ended the timer at the right timing. It was more complicated with the game modes that I have. I think through the steps and logic of the game play and tested it numerous times to make sure that I setted it correctly. 

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? <br />
Knowing how powerful libraries can be, I wonder what percentage of libraries that we can access are actually usable for projects that are not for personal usages. If we can use them, how would we credit the libraries? I also wonder if there can be there any security concerns of the codes that we write for webs? <br />
Just seeing how much can be done with one person, I am curious to see how web development feels like when the developer is a large team. What are the main differences between small and large team projects? Usually, how are people assigned to work on different part of the web page? Is it more similar to one person per page or is it more similar to one person per function?

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc).  <br />
I would like to add a difficulty setting where the user can choose the difficulty(3 levels) that they want, and as the difficulty increases, the speed of the pattern being shown will be increased, the amount of patterns to remember will be increased, and the time given would be decreased. It would also be fun if I can randomize where the buttons(the pets) appear in the page after the pattern is shown, and then ask the users to remember their appearences. To make to harder, I can add a lot of random animals in and make it hard to find the specific buttons(pets). There could also be random backgrounds in the game and make it looks like the pets are actually in the environment. There are many things that can be done to this project!
