[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
First time using javascript, html, and css

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
will we be able to work on this? what is the main difference between small and large projects

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
I would like to add a difficulty setting where the user can choose the difficulty(3 levels) that they want, and as the difficulty increases, the speed of the pattern being shown will be increased, the amount of patterns to remember will be increased, and the time given would be decreased. It would also be fun if I can randomize where the buttons(the pets) appear in the page after the pattern is shown, and then ask the users to remember their appearences. To make to harder, I can add a lot of random animals in and make it hard to find the specific buttons(pets). There could also be random backgrounds in the game and make it looks like the pets are actually in the environment. There are many things that can be done to this project!
